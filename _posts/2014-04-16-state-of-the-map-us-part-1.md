This is part one of two of what I learned at SOTMUS. I'll split it up into day one and day two

This year was my first time to attend SOTMUS. The only other geo conference I attended was Where Conf in 2011 and 2012. I was half expecting something similar to Where Conf, but I was completely mistaken (in a good way).

##Initial Impression

* The OSM community is incredible
* The MapBox garage functions very well as a party venue
* PBR is much better than what I remember 12 years ago
* Very rarely do you see a group of 500 people that are so welcoming
* Cartography is a beautiful art. It's also a very hard thing to wrap your head around
* MapBox could probably fill an entire conference with their own presentations from every member of their team

##Presentations
Here are some random thoughts on some of the presentations. I would encourage you to check out the linked videos and the presenters' twitter accounts

####[Make Maps Better Together](http://stateofthemap.us/session/make-maps-better-together/){:target="_blank"} - [Mike Skalnik](https://twitter.com/skalnik){:target="_blank"}
* open formats win out from closed formats
* collaborative > silo'd labor
* simplicity > complexity
* pragmatic > perfect
* use dumb formats and smart tools
* treat data as code
* i knew you could view GeoJSON straight from git, but did not know you could diff the GeoJSON

####[Faites Vos Jeux: Announcing MapRoulette Next Generation](http://stateofthemap.us/session/faites-vos-jeux/){:target="_blank"} - [Martijn van Exel](https://twitter.com/mvexel){:target="_blank"}
* fix OSM one bug at a time
* perfect way to get involved in OSM community
* very functional, does what it was made to do and nothing more
* license change a while back really screwed with the data
* great way to track osm bugs and make it fun to fix them
* will definitely be playing with this in the future

####[More Open](http://stateofthemap.us/session/more-open/){:target="_blank"} - [Alex Barth](https://twitter.com/lxbarth){:target="_blank"}
* there is a lot passion within the OSM community
* like any other organization, there are different thoughts on licensing
* lawyers hate ambiguity
* share-alike clause of ODbL introduces incompatibilities
* you shouldn't have to change your licensing just to be able to derive data from and publicly use OSM data.
* attended the birds of a feather session on this...will likely have a separate post on this

####[Implementing Change in OpenStreetMap](http://stateofthemap.us/session/implementing-change-in-openstreetmap/){:target="_blank"} - [John Firebaugh](https://twitter.com/jfire){:target="_blank"}
* id editor and osm.org redesign
* foundation of mapbox is osm. there is an alignment of interest
* users tend to be conservative - loss aversion/status quo bias
* check out [building compassionate communities in tech](http://www.joyent.com/developers/videos/nodeconfeu-2013-building-compassionate-communities-in-tech){:target="_blank"}
* perfect is the enemy of much better now

####[Engaging the OpenStreetMap Community](http://stateofthemap.us/session/engaging-the-osm-community/){:target="_blank"} - [Colin Reilly](https://twitter.com/ColinReillyNY){:target="_blank"}
* how messed up is NYC's addresses?
* DoITT is a pretty cool department name
* borough presidents have very weird responsibilities
* the power of the community is amazing
* email changes to NYC from OSM is all because of licensing (and NYC data is public)

####[Pelias: A New OpenStreetMap Geocoder with Elasticsearch](http://stateofthemap.us/session/pelias/){:target="_blank"} - [Randy Meech](https://twitter.com/randyme){:target="_blank"}
* Elasticsearch is pretty sweet out of the box
* Can only imagine how nice this will be when tiger and open addresses are added
* Pretty cool UI for search and suggested options in the demo
* How scary is it to be presenting and running a demo from your servers...I would be sweating


I'll cover the second day presentations tomorrow...
